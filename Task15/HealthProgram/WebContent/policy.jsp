Your privacy is important to Giant Eagle and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to Giant Eagle and the Healthier Choices Program.
This Privacy Policy explains what information we may acquire about you, our customer, through the Giant Eagle website, Giant Eagle Advantage Program, and Giant Eagle Pharmacy, and how we may use that information. When you use the Giant Eagle Advantage card or Pharmacy, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
We may revise this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" legend at the end of the policy. This Privacy Policy also applies to any of our other websites and/or apps that post and/or link to this Privacy Policy. It does not apply to third party websites and/or apps that post different statements addressing users’ privacy. Our Sites are controlled by Giant Eagle in the United States and are subject to its laws.

What Kind of Information is Collected About You?
Information You Provide. We collect the following information that you provide:
The Advantage Card. In order to provide you with the benefits of the Advantage Card program (including the accrual and use of fuelperks!®, and fuelperks+® where available), Giant Eagle must obtain certain information including your name and address, your record of purchases, and other information that you may elect to give. You voluntarily provided some of this information when you applied for your Advantage Card and the Information is supplemented each time you use the Advantage Card. Giant Eagle collects and retains this information whether or not you register on or use any of our Sites. You may elect to register your Card on certain of our Sites, which will make this information accessible to you through our Sites. 
Personally identifiable information means any information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name (first and last), address (city, state, zip), email address, date of birth, telephone number, etc. Your Advantage Card number is not personally identifiable information unless it is accompanied by your name, address, or password.
Registration Information. In order to obtain certain services on our Sites, you must register with the site or app and provide information that personally identifies you or permits us to contact you. This includes your name, address, date of birth and certain preferences. You may also provide information when you purchase products from our Sites or through links accessed through our Sites. You may browse our Sites without registering; in that case, your visit will remain anonymous unless you otherwise provide personal information during your visit. If you choose not to register or provide information, you can still view most of our Sites, with the exception of those areas that require registration. Note, however, that the features of the Sites available to an unregistered user may be significantly limited.
Giant Eagle Pharmacy. In order to provide you with the most relevant products, the Healthier Choices Program may have access to protected health information if you are enrolled in the Pharmacy program. Protected Health information will only be used if you enroll in this program and will not be personally identifiable to you. See the Notice of Pharmacy Privacy Practices for more details.

to enforce our rights in contracts or transactions that you participate in with us.
If your Advantage Card is owned jointly with another person, we will disclose your shopping history to the other person(s) on the account, if requested.
